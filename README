# CCON
ccon is container-like application written in pure C.
This is a small hobby repo, the purpose was to learn about linux namespaces and cgroups.

## Making
   `make` will generate you a `cconfs` directory containing a busybox and an empty rootfs-like directory tree.

## Usage
   Typical usage is to pop a shell inside the container and then to do anything you want:
   `./ccon /bin/busybox sh`
   In order to be able to launch every busybox cmd without having to write `busybox <cmd>` you can run `busybox --install` inside the ccontainer.
